                At UofT Toastmasters, we create a supportive environment
                where everyone can improve their public speaking and leadership skills.
                We originally began as an engineering student club in 2004,
                but today our members are students and non-students! 
                Since then, we've helped hundreds of students rise above their fears,
                grow into incredible speakers, and live as stronger leaders.
                We want to help you realize your potential too!
                Associated with Toastmasters International,
                we are open to all guests and welcome everyone to visit our regular meetings.

            <h2>President's Welcome</h2>
            <p id="welcome-body">
                Hello! You’re probably here reading this because you’re interested
                in developing your public speaking skills,
                and you’re interested in what our club can offer.
                So hi, on behalf of U of T Toastmasters, I’d like to welcome you to our website.
                On paper, U of T Toastmasters is a public speaking and leadership development club,
                but in reality, it’s so much more than that.
                While I’ve learned invaluable tips on how to seem more confident on stage
                and how to deliver a rousing speech,
                I’ve also gained things that aren’t as easy to advertise.
                I’ve gained a sense of confidence around strangers,
                lost my fear of awkward silences, and found a creative outlet.
                Toastmasters is what you make of it,
                and I’ve found it’s contributed an important part to the development of my character.
                But don’t just take it from me, feel free to drop in to one of our meetings.
                I hope that Toastmasters can help you on your personal journey, as it has helped me with mine,
                and we invite you to join our meetings and become part of our Toastmasters family.
            </p>

                    My favourite part about the club is that it gives me a creative outlet
                    and a way for me to challenge myself and get better at something.
                    In my (limited) free time, I like to watch cartoons and do the crossword.
